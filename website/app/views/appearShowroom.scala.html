    <h1>Appear Showroom website</h1>

    <p id="intro"><a href="https://www.appearshowroom.com" target="_blank">www.appearshowroom.com</a> is a website
        showcasing the features of the <a href="https://www.appeariq.com" target="_blank">Appear IQ</a> product. Graphic
        design was done by <a href="http://www.lwyd.co.uk" target="_blank">Tom Knowles</a>. It contains some advanced
        features, such as letting the user interact with pure JavaScript webapps in an iframe. These are mobile JS
        webapps developed with Appear IQ.</p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>I coded the backend of the website (<a href="https://www.playframework.com">Play Framework Scala</a> & <a
            href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> database), and some of the frontend (based on the <a
            href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> framework).</p>

        <p>After choosing a webapp, you can configure it several ways: such as its layout and data on the backend. The right section
        contains an iframe where the JavaScript webapp is executed. The app can be tested in real time!</p>

        <p>It's so fun to play with the webapp in the iframe that we added a real-size preview.</p>
