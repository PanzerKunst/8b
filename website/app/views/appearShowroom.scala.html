<h1>Appear Showroom website</h1>

<p id="intro"><a href="https://www.appearshowroom.com" target="_blank">www.appearshowroom.com</a> is a website
    showcasing the features of the <a href="https://www.appeariq.com" target="_blank">Appear IQ</a> product. Graphic
    design was done by <a href="www.lwyd.co.uk" target="_blank">Tom Knowles</a>, and development was carried out
    in-house. It contains some advanced features, such as letting the user interact with pure JavaScript webapps in an
    iframe. These are mobile JS webapps developed with Appear IQ.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I coded the backend of the website (Play Framework Scala & CouchDB database), and some of the frontend (based on the
    Backbone.js framework).</p>
